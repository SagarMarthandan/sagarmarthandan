**PROJECTS**

__Star Schema for Enterprise Sales Analytics. *Tools*__*: Power BI, Power Query (M), DAX, SQL.*

- Architected a robust, high-performance **Star Schema** model after leveraging **Power Query** (M language) for extensive data cleansing and transformation
- Engineered complex **DAX measures** and calculated columns to derive key business metrics for sales, customer, and product analysis.
- Developed and deployed interactive dashboards that translate complex business data into clear, **actionable insights** for stakeholders.

__Scalable Data Transformation Pipelines. *Tools*__*: Snowflake, dbt, SQL, Jinja.*

- Architected and implemented high-performance dimensional models (Star Schema) using dbt on Snowflake, optimizing the data structure for analytical querying speed to be used in Power BI
- Optimized transformation logic via advanced Spark and Snowflake tuning techniques, achieving a measured 30-40 percent reduction in compute time and cost.
- Elevated data integrity and transformation efficiency by developing reusable Jinja macros and implementing automated dbt quality tests (unique, not-null).

**End-To-End Formula One Data Processing. Tools:** *Azure Databricks, PySpark, Delta Lake, ADF, ADLS Gen2.*

- Designed and implemented end-to-end data pipelines using Azure Databricks, PySpark, and Delta Lake for batch and real-time processing.
- Applied Medallion architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold) to transform and optimize data workflows in Databricks Lakehouse.
- Leveraged Spark SQL and Databricks Notebooks for data analysis, transformation, and visualization, including incremental data loading and job orchestration.
- Integrated Azure Databricks with Azure Data Factory, developed trigger-based dataflows, and automated ETL processes for seamless orchestration and scalable data engineering solutions.

__Master Thesis: Subspace Poisoning in High Dimensional Data. *Tools:*__ *Python, pandas, scikit-learn*__ 

- Developed and implemented a PCA based outlier detection method using Median Absolute Deviation, improving anomaly detection in high-dimensional datasets.
- Achieved a 10 percent increase in detection accuracy for cancer and symmetrically distributed datasets, enabling more compact and correlated data for machine learning and neural network applications
